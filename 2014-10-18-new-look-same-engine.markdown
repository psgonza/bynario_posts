Dear reader, if you have ever been in a (long) business trip, you would problably agree with me on this:

**_"At the end, long business trips are pretty boring"_** _(ok, ok, it depends on the place)_

I have been in Amman (Jordan) for the past few weeks. I have seeing what could be seen around (not that much IMO), but since now I have some "spare" time, I have decided to take another look at Octopress.  (I still think I would be better off without Ruby though :-P)

So, as you can see, I have modified the CSS of the site to make it cleaner and lighter, because I never really like dark styles.

Actually, this is how bynario.com looked like in 2005 (I found this in [archive.org](https://www.archive.org)):

{% img center img/bynarioSS-feb2006.JPG  '2006' %}

And this is in 2011 (I hosted this site in blogger for a few months):

{% img center img/bynarioSS-oct2011.JPG  '2011' %}

And finally, since June 2012, I have been running Octopress with just some small modifications over the default theme:

{% img center img/bynarioSS-oct2014.JPG  '2014' %}

Now I just need to stop procrastinating and post more often... Easier said than done!

Bye
