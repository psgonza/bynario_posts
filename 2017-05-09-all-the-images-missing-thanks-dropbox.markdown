I bet nobody noticed but all the images in the blog were not here anymore... No pictures, no logo, etc. Ooops!

I was using dropbox as storage for the blog images, and a while ago they decided to change the policy about their public folders. Bummer!

I don't think Dropbox is to blame here though. They provide a really good service (for free!) and I guess they have to draw a line somewhere.

Anyway, I will be storing the images in the server from now on, so I am updating the posts and changing the image paths.

Bye
