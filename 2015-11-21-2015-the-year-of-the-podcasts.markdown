Well, I know I might be very late on this, but for me, 2015 has been the year I have (re)discovered the podcasts...

According to Wikipedia podcasts are 10 years old, but I never really put to much attention into them until this year. I have been an avid user of RSS feeds since long time ago, so I never really had the need of listening other people's opinions when you can read a blog post about it (way faster than listening).

But, as it happens to almost everybody, I reached a point in life where I don't have time to spare in reading +100 post every day... Adulthood sucks, I guess (and I don't have family responsabilities, I cannot imagine how people survive to parenting.)

Earlier this year I was in a business trip in Tokyo when spring came, and with the nice weather I started to take long walks (one of the best ways to disconnect from work and with a lof of health benefits according to some [studies](http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleID=2108914)). 

First I tried to take my kindle with me, but it slows you down and you end up walking really slowly. Then I tried with audiobooks, not a bad solution at all, but not cheap (more expensive than kindle books for sure), and I'd rather read at the same time I enjoy a cup of coffee...

So not sure why, I recalled podcasts... I had already listen some of them in my laptop every now and then, but never really bothered to used my Android phone as a media player. And they were exactly what I was after:

1 - They are not a replacement for the blog post, but it might be the closest thing.
2 - You can listen to them while you walk/run/conmute/whatever.
3 - They are really cheap (some of them have sponsors or ask you for donation).
4 - There are several nice Android apps that handle the subscrition for you.

The number of available podcast is incredible. In my case I am mostly interested in technology, but I am sure that, on any given topic you are insterested in, there are several podcasts out there waiting for you (speaking english makes it easier of course). 

This is my current [Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en) subscription list:
