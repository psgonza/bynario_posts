Yesterday I attended a very interesting workshop in [ShuttleCloud](https://www.shuttlecloud.com/) offices in Madrid about [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/)...

I'd say most of the people already knew a little bit about Docker (at least basic knowledge), but it was the first time with Kubernetes for most of us... It was a very good introduction to the technology, and we spent a few hours playing around with pods,services and replicationcontrollers in our own cluster (it is pretty simple to setup a small environment using [Vagrant](http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/docs/getting-started-guides/vagrant.html) or [Google Cloud Engine](https://cloud.google.com/free-trial/).

I'd love to attend to more whole-day events like this one (lunch was a plus, but it is not needed whatsoever)

This is a picture of all the participants:

Thanks to [Ivan](https://twitter.com/ipedrazas) and [Alex](https://twitter.com/agonzalezro) for sharing their knowledge, and of course, to [jobandtalent](https://twitter.com/jobandtalentEng) for providing the lunch!
