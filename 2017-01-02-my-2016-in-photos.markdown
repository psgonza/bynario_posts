(Pretty big pictures, sorry about that)

Saying hello to another year with some pictures... 2016 is been a good year, both personally and professionally:

- I've been working in Japan for several months again... Best place for living as expat (IMO)

- April: I never really liked south east Asia that much (too hot for my taste), but I have to say I had a really good time in Vietnam and Cambodia... Looking forward to going back there soon!

- July: Raising sun at the top of Mt Fuji

- August: Hawaii is the place to be. Period.

- December: Vienna (European capital of Xmas) & Salzburg

I hope 2017 is as good as 2016, although I'd like to make some changes... 

Happy New Year everyone
