[Googreads](https://www.goodreads.com) is a great social media platform for reading lovers... It allows you to discover new books, keep track of your reading (it is even integrated with Amazon Kidle) or recommend books to your friends... If reading is one of your hibbies, you should check it out.
 
It's far from impressive I know (some of my friends are able to read more than 40 books in a year.. don't ask me how) but, despite Netflix, I managed to read 14 books (and I have another two books "in progess"):
