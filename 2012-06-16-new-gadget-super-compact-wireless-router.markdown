I am staying a few weeks in Japan, and it seems that here, most of the hotels still offer wired LAN as the only way to connect to the internet, instead of WiFi ([I'm sorry, are you from the past?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKYQ5ibxslI)).

I usually travel with my smartphone and tablet (and a laptop of course), and they don.t have RJ45 connector, so I .need. a wireless network for them.

Last week, I spent a few hours walking around in Akihabara, the electronic district here in Tokyo, and I bought this cheap (around 24Eur) AP/wireless router: [LAN-W300N/PR5 (by ELECON Logitec)](http://www.logitec.co.jp/products/network/wireless_home.html).

Inside of the package you will find the power adapter (micro USB 5V/0.6A), a LAN cable (really short), and instructions (in a perfect Japanese):

The device is really small, I would say it is the size of a old cassette tape. It has 4 LAN 10/100 ports, 1  LAN port for WAN and 2 USB ports (mini and micro USB) for the power supply:

The device is working just out of the box, acting as AP and as neutral router. This is the default configuration:

External network: 
	DHCP client
Internal network:
	LAN: 192.168.2.1/24
WLAN:</BR>
	SSID: logitecuser
	Encryption: WPA2/PSK (You will find the password written under your device.)</BR>

Unfortunately, the router utility setup is completely in Japanese, which makes any change a little bit more difficult (but Google Translator does the job).

You can access the web setup using admin/admin

I have to say that this gadget is not meant to be a .top performer.. Actually, I had a few issues using Skype video-call, so keep that in mind before buying it. It is very cheap, and I would say that it is enough for web surfing and connecting your smartphone, tablet, microwave (-: when you are traveling, but not for being used on a regular basis.

Conclusions:
PROS: Cheap, really portable, works with a USB (5V), 4 10/100 ports, and oh yes, cheap!
CONS: Configuration utility in Japanese, average performance, not easy to buy outside Japan.

Sayonara!
