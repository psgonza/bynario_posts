We just said goodbye to 2016, and as in [2015](https://bynario.com/2016-1-1-my-books-in-2015.html), here it goes my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) summary:

Unfortunately, I failed my reading challenge... I read 10 of the 13 books in the first half of the year, but I have been stuck with a Python book for months. And podcasts have not helped much :)

Happy reading!
