Finally I had some time to move away from Octopress... After trying a couple of [Python static web generators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/StaticSiteGenerator) I decided to give [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) a try.

The "migration" was pretty easy. Install it via pip, configure your list of plugins and pages, update your posts (you have to do slightly modifications to your Octopress header posts) and you are good to go... I even managed to keep the same design I already had (thanks to this [octopress theme](https://github.com/duilio/pelican-octopress-theme)) 

So far, it feels good to have an easy bloggin platform in Python, so I totally recommend the change!

Later
