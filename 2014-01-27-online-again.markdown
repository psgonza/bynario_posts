It's been a while.... but better late than never, isn't it? I am back online (I never left, but this site didn't come back after a VPS migration)...  

Not a single post in 2013... "Working, working and working" that would sum up the whole last year.

These are my thoughts about a few things that happened in 2013:

- RaspberryPi:

I got mine (pre-ordered) in the fall of 2011... Well actually I paid it then, but it was delivered in Jun 2012. In 2013 I bought another one to use it as a media center with raspbmc. What a piece of HW for only 37 euros.  

- Python:

I know I know, Python is OLD, but believe or not, I never used it before until 2013. I am not a developer, but Bash and Perl gave me pretty much everything I needed... Until I started to play with Python, it's easy, fast, and there are modules for almost everything you can think of. 

- Ansible: 

According to them, "a radically simple IT orchestration solution", and you bet it is. Give it a chance if you can. Way easier than Puppet/Chef/Fabric...

- G+: 

I think the number of users in Google+ is ramping up mainly because it's mandatory if you want to use some Google products. Unfortunatelly, it didn't reach my expecations. There are some interesing stuff, but I am kind of bored of seeing animated gifs.

- New family member:

After a few years using "old" computers (and my company laptop), I decided to buy a Lenovo x230, together with a 256GB Samsung SSD 840 PRO. To put is simple, it is F.A.S.T. As usually, GNU/Debian is the OS of choice. Still, some days I have second thoughs about it. Should I have bought a MBA 11" or this one?? I haven't reach any conclusion yet :)

- Bye bye Google Reader

At the end, it wasn't a big deal. I had been a G.Reader power user for years, but due to my limited time, I started to check my feeds in the tablet (Nexus 7 2012) instead than in the laptop, and moving to Feedly was a smooth migration. You know what they say... the king is dead, long live the king.

- Iceland and again to the US:

I did spent the whole year working long hours and weekends, but at least, I could take a few days off (in two different periods) and visited Iceland and some cities in the US East Coast. Iceland is amazing, it is like Jurasic Park (geologically speaking). You should totally go.

And again, back to the US... We had a really good time, as usual.

I will try to write a few post this year, but I can't promise anything

//Bye
