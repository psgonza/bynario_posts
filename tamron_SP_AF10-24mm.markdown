I am not a pro photographer and don't like to spend a fortune in gear for my camera, but I've always wanted to by a ultrawide lense...

I had the opportunity to buy the (http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/tamron-10-24-3p5-5p6-n15)[Tamron SP AF10-24mm] for a decent price, and so far I am liking it... See a couple of pics I took a few days ago:

Not the best uw lense out there, but good enough for landscapes!
